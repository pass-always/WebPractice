      <h2>Establishment</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in the 10th century by Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw,
        Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin, Hogwarts was established in the
        Highlands of Scotland to educate young wizards and witches as well as to
        keep students safe from muggle persecution. Theory has it that Rowena
        Ravenclaw came up with the name of Hogwarts after dreaming of a warty
        hog that led her to a cliff by a lake.[5] Since then, Hogwarts educated
        most wizarding children in the United Kingdom and its surrounding areas,
        keeping its location hidden from other wizarding schools and muggles.

      <h2>Middle ages</h2>
      About three hundred years after the school was founded, the Triwizard
      Tournament was established as an interscholastic competition among the
      three most prestigious magical schools in Europe: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons,
      and Durmstrang. The tournament continued for six centuries, but was
      discontinued after 1994.
